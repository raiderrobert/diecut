That's it. diecut prompts you for variables and generates a ready-to-go project.

## Why diecut?

I built diecut because I tend to make lots of projects for fun. I get a stack I like, and I don't like messing around with the setup. I enjoyed cookiecutter back in the day, but I found it complicating my life more than simplifying it. 

I aimed to solve four things:

- **Single binary**: I've often just wanted to download a binary and no faff with Python stuff, even though I wrote mostly Python.
- **Easy to make**: I wanted it to be dead simple to make templates with as few footguns as possible.
- **Multi-template repos**: I dabble a lot in different stacks and languages, but I'd rather not have 5 different repos for my templates. This felt like a good way to organize them.
- **Dry run**: sometimes I want to see what the result will look like before I commit to it.
