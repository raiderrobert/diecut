## Why diecut?

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Single binary" icon="rocket">
		No Python, no Node.js, no runtime dependencies. Install once and go.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Cookiecutter compatible" icon="puzzle">
		Use existing cookiecutter templates directly — diecut auto-detects and translates them on the fly.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Template updates" icon="refresh">
		Update previously generated projects when the upstream template changes, with three-way merge.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Cross-platform hooks" icon="setting">
		Hooks run in Rhai, a sandboxed scripting language compiled into the binary. Same behavior everywhere.
	</Card>
