import { LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Install

The quickest way:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raiderrobert/diecut/main/install.sh | sh
```

Auto-detects your OS and architecture. Set `DIECUT_INSTALL_DIR` to change the install location.

Build from source:

```bash
cargo install --path crates/diecut-cli
```

Or grab a binary from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/raiderrobert/diecut/releases).

## Your first project

Use the built-in `rust-cli` example template:

```bash
diecut new ./examples/rust-cli -o my-cli
```

diecut reads the template config and prompts you for five variables:

```text
Project name [my-cli]: my-cli
Short description [A command-line application]:
Author name: Jane Doe
License [MIT]: MIT
  1. MIT
  2. Apache-2.0
  3. MIT OR Apache-2.0
Rust edition [2021]: 2021
  1. 2021
  2. 2024
```

Press Enter to accept the defaults. Once done, you get a ready-to-build project:

```text
my-cli/
  Cargo.toml
  src/
    main.rs
  .gitignore
  .diecut-answers.toml
```

The generated `Cargo.toml` has your variables applied:

```toml
[package]
name = "my-cli"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
description = "A command-line application"
authors = ["Jane Doe"]
license = "MIT"
```

## What just happened?

diecut read the `diecut.toml` config, prompted you for variables, and rendered every `.tera` file through the Tera template engine. The `.tera` suffix was stripped from output filenames. Files without `.tera` were copied as-is. Your answers were saved to `.diecut-answers.toml` for future updates.
