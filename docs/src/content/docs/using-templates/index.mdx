## Template sources

diecut pulls templates from local paths or any Git host.

| Source | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Local path | `diecut new ./my-template` |
| GitHub | `diecut new gh:user/repo` |
| GitLab | `diecut new gl:user/repo` |
| Bitbucket | `diecut new bb:user/repo` |
| Sourcehut | `diecut new sr:user/repo` |
| Any Git URL | `diecut new https://git.example.com/repo.git` |

Git templates are cached at `~/.cache/diecut/templates/`. Override with `DIECUT_CACHE_DIR`.

## Overriding variables

Pass `-d key=value` to skip prompts for specific variables:

```bash
diecut new gh:user/template -d project_name=foo -d license=MIT -o my-project
```

Variables passed with `-d` skip the interactive prompt. You can mix — pass some via `-d` and diecut prompts for the rest.

## Non-interactive mode

For CI pipelines or scripting, use `--defaults`:

```bash
diecut new gh:user/template --defaults -o my-project
```

Every variable uses its default value. No prompts. Combine with `-d` to override specific ones:

```bash
diecut new gh:user/template --defaults -d project_name=ci-test -o output
```

## Updating a project

You generated a project three months ago. The template author added a new CI config and updated the README. Instead of starting over:

```bash
diecut update ./my-project
```

Here is what happens:

1. Reads `.diecut-answers.toml` from your project. This file stores the template source and your original variable choices.
2. Renders the template at the original version (old snapshot).
3. Renders at the latest version (new snapshot).
4. Three-way merges against your actual files.
5. Reports files updated, added, removed, and any conflicts.

Pin to a specific version:

```bash
diecut update ./my-project --ref v2.0.0
```

Conflicts are saved as `.rej` files. You resolve them manually, like `patch` conflicts.

## Cookiecutter compatibility

diecut auto-detects cookiecutter templates:

```bash
diecut new gh:audreyfeldroy/cookiecutter-pypackage -o my-package
```

It finds `cookiecutter.json`, translates the format on the fly, and prompts you as usual. No migration needed.

For a permanent conversion to native diecut format, see [Migrating from Cookiecutter](/migrating-from-cookiecutter/).

## Managing the cache

List cached templates:

```bash
diecut list
```

Templates live at `~/.cache/diecut/templates/`. Set `DIECUT_CACHE_DIR` to change the location. Delete the directory to clear the cache.
